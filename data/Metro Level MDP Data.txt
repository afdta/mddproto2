Hi Alec,
 
I’m attaching the metro level data for the multidimensional poverty data project. As I mentioned yesterday, they replicate the information in the first couple of charts in the national draft I shared.
 
I’ve suppressed cells that don’t meet the Census’ sample size for reporting (those are the entries marked with N). The data are pretty straightforward. If we were able to move forward with an interactive, a basic one that let users see the metro data displayed in bar charts that compare disadvantages across races (like the national paper) would probably do the trick.
 
But there’s one other wrinkle to add.
 
After conferring with our in-house PUMS experts, we agreed that because we’re dealing with single year data, we should also report margins of error. That would mean that, if we went the bar char route, the bars should probably come with the margin of error bands as well.
 
With our travel schedules coming up, we wouldn’t be able to get the actual margins of error to you until the last week of February (although we could fill in dummy values if that would be helpful for playing with the data).
 
So that’s the long and short of it. Happy to answer any questions, and we look forward to hearing what you think might work best (including if you think we ought to forego the interactive this time around).
 
Thanks,
Elizabeth
